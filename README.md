# VBA of Wall Street 

## Purpose
Our firm has been tasked by our benefactor, Steve, to write a code script to analyze stock prices.  In the beginning, Steve was interested in the "DQ" stock due to a boom in price for FY17.  However, the "DQ" stock price came back to earth in 2018 which prompted our stock analysis to widen.  

## Results
After widening the scope of stocks for analysis, it was identified there were only two stocks with positive returns in 2018.  This is a stark contrast from 2017 when 11 out of 12 were in the green.

## Built for Efficiency
Following the completion of this process, our benefactors requested a refactoring of the code for efficiency.  Their plan is to use this tool for Mass scale stock analysis.  The results of our refactoring decreased the computation of our code by 0.4 seconds for each year analyzed.

## Summary of Findings
Through the course of this project, we have utilized all of our resources and learned a few new tricks along the way.  Refactoring code can be tedious and difficult when it's unknown how to proceed.  However, practice, determination and consultation, in this instance, has brought us to an improved outcome.

An improvement of 0.4 seconds in processing 12 stocks may not seem like a big hurdle. However, 12,000 (or more!) stocks processing could make a large difference in a time-oriented specialty like stock trading.  ...Minutes and Seconds boiled down to Dollars and Cents!

Thank you for contracting our services and we look forward to working with you in the future!
