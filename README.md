# VBA of Wall Street 

## Purpose

Our firm has been tasked by our benefactor, Steve, to write a code to analyze stock prices.  In the beginning, Steve was interested in the "DQ" stock due to a boom in price for FY17.  However, the "DQ" stock price came back to earth in 2018 which prompted our stock analysis to widen.  

## Results

After widening the scope of stocks for analysis, it was identified there were only two stocks with positive returns in 2018.  This is a stark contrast from 2017 when 11 out of 12 were in the green.
