# VBA of Wall Street 

## Purpose

Our firm has been tasked by our benefactor, Steve, to write a code to analyze stock prices.  In the beginning, Steve was interested in the "DQ" stock due to a boom in price for FY17.  However, the "DQ" stock price came back to earth in 2018 which prompted our stock analysis to widen.  

## Results

After widening the scope of stocks for analysis, it was identified there were only two stocks with positive returns in 2018.  This is a stark contrast from 2017 when 11 out of 12 were in the green.

Following the completion of this process, our benefactors requested a refactoring of the code for efficiency.  Their plan is to use this tool for Mass scale stock analysis.  The results of our refactoring decreased the computation of our code by 0.4 seconds for each year analyzed.
